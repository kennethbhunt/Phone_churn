This is an anlysis of a data set containing 6 variables, and 1000 observations. The response variable of this dataset is "churn", which describes where a customer will leave the company based on the other variables which are "predictors". 


```{r}
phone <- read.csv("phone.csv")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
ggplot(phone, aes(churn)) + geom_bar(fill="red") +
  labs(title="Phone Company Sales Churn", subtitle="Class Imbalance Problem", caption="Kenneth B. Hunt, MBA", face="bold")
```
As we can see in the initial plot, we are facing a severe class imbalance problem that will need to be addressed in order to have high performance in most algorithms.
